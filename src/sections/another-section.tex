  Let \( \br{\vc{r}_1, ..., \vc{r}_n} \) be 
    positions of nodes on cell surface and 
    let \( \mathcal{N}_i(t) \) denote 
    the neighbouring nodes of 
    node \( i \) at time \( t \). 

	\vspace*{12pt}
  
  Assume inertial terms are small enough to be 
    inconsequential compared to
    dissipative terms 
    in equation of motion:

	\begin{align*}
		\eta \ddx{\vc{r}_i}{t} = \vc{B}_i(t)\; + 
			\sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}_{i}(t)} \vc{F}_{i j}(t),
  \end{align*}
  
  where \( \eta \) is a drag coefficient, 
    \(\vc{F}_{i j}\) denotes the force on node \(i\) from node \(j\) and 
    \(\vc{B}_i(t)\) is the sum of other forces on node \(i\) at time \(t\).
